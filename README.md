# Personal Portfolio 

The 3rd iteration of my personal website, this time built with Gatsby.

## Hosting

So for some reason, I was still paying for hosting? However, working with gatsby introduced me to netlify which allowed me to reallocate my hosting budget to analytics, awesome.


## Take-Aways

Thanks to the reusable nature of React, I was able to structure my blog in a way that allows me to create new articles FAST, using custom responsive and stateful components.
